## About machine learning Model

* The  model takes the input in the form of a CSV file which contains the database brain waves in Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma waves. Then it gives the output which is the probability of having the cognitive disorder.
* Its a  neural network based on LSTM( long short term memory) and consists of Input layer, dense layer, bidirectional LSTM layer, dropout layer and flatten layer.
* The normalization of the data is done through the .fit Transform() method.
* The 85% of data (nearly 10889 values)  is used for training and the remaining 15% of the data (nearly 1922 values) is used for testing  the model.
* Total of 73.76% of accuracy is achieved from the model.
